1) With my data structures, developers can access and manipulate data via the indices of an array. In "Line of people", each person occupies an index of the members array which corresponds to their position on the line. In "Screen", I set up a matrix where (array.length = width) and (sub_array.length = height).

2) If a developer wants to find a specific element in the data structure for "Line", they would simply have to utilize the "search" instance method which returns the "person" if they're in line and "nil" if not. They could also use the "first", "middle" and "back" instance methods to locate the person at those positions. For finding a specific element in the data structure for "Screen", the developer has to provide the "x" and "y" values to the "at" instance method which will first check to see if those coordinates are within the boundaries of the screen; if so it'll return the pixel at that position.

3) The "Line" data structure could also represent data such as ordered to-do's, vehicles moving on a one way street, job queues, admissions list and various other ordered queue/list type data. The "Screen" data structure could represent pieces on a chess/checker board, vacant spots in a parking lot, occupied/unoccupied seats at a theater and various other matrix/grid style data.
