1) Spatial Locality is one of two terms used to define a node's locality of reference behavior. A node is said to have Spatial Locality if it's values exist in close memory locations(i.e. are close in memory space(RAM, CACHE, etc.)). This benefits performance
because it lessens the workload of a machine when attempting to locate a node at a specific memory address.

2) Benchmarks:
- Test 1(Time to add 10,000 items)
	- Array => .050 Milliseconds(local machine)
	- Linked List => 4543.275 Milliseconds(local machine)
- Test 2(Time to access 5000th item)
	- Array => .001 Milliseconds(local machine)
	- Linked List => .005 Milliseconds(local machine)
- Test 3(Remove the 5000th item)
	- Array => .005 Milliseconds(local machine)
	- Linked List => .725 Milliseconds(local machine)
